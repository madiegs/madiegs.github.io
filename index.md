Hello, my name is Diegs, and I'm a first-year IT student aspiring to be a decent malware analyst

As you can see, I'm studying a lot of technologies these days, which may or may not be a good thing, but I'm doing it because I want to see what technology has to offer before committing to a single profession; IT is broad, and I'm still young and have plenty of time to figure out what I really want.
